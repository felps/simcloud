/**
 * A host object represents a location (any possible place) where a process may run. 
 * Thus it is represented as a physical resource with computing capabilities, some 
 * mailboxes to enable running process to communicate with remote ones, and some private 
 * data that can be only accessed by local process. An instance of this class is always 
 * binded with the corresponding native host. All the native hosts are automatically created 
 * during the call of the method Msg.createEnvironment(). This method take as parameter a
 * platform file which describes all elements of the platform (host, link, root..).
 * You cannot create a host yourself.
 *
 * The best way to get an host instance is to call the static method 
 * Host.getByName().
 *
 * For example to get the instance of the host. If your platform
 * file description contains an host named "Jacquelin" :
 *
 * \verbatim
Host jacquelin;

try { 
	jacquelin = Host.getByName("Jacquelin");
} catch(HostNotFoundException e) {
	System.err.println(e.toString());
}
...
\endverbatim
